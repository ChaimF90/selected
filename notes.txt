since reminders are limited to 3 a week, once a candidate has gotten a reminder of any sort we must wait at least 
2 days till we send another reminder. Given that reminders are not sent on Saturday or Sunday this will ensure that
there will never be more than 3 a week. On a day where a candidate should be getting a reminder, give priority 
to messages and give priority to higher level. If no messages, and faced with a choice of different pending invites, send the highest level.
If there are multiple with the same level, send them in the same reminder.

STEPS TO TAKE:

First, is it older than at least one day?
if it is, was a reminder already sent out for this? 
If it has not yet had any reminders its a potential.
if it did already have a reminder, then can it be escalated to the next level?
if it can be then its a potential, otherwise its not.

from the potentials we must filter down to just one reminder.
if there is a message, then we have a winner.
if we only have invites, we choose the highest level.
When multiple invites share the same level, which happens to be the highest,
then they are collectively the winners (which means they would get sent together as one reminder)

finally we have the reminder we want to send. Now we need to make sure that at least two days have passed since the last reminder.
If we have 2 days which have passed since last reminder, we send it out, if not we do nothing.

if we have multiple messages, we must also choose the highest level. If they share the same level they should be batched.
